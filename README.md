# Coding Challenge

The purpose of this challenge is to understand your coding skills and practices.
**Please treat this repository as your own open source project, as if you were collaborating with other contributors.**

### Goal

Create a camera app that allows the user to take a selfie and show the face detection result.

### Requirements

- Use Kotlin (for Android) or Swift (for iOS).
- Implement the camera selfie feature with official Android or iOS API.
- Use [imagga](https://imagga.com/)'s API - `/faces/detections` result to draw the face locations.
  - Please sign up and get the API key
  - `POST` the selfie photo to `/faces/detections` and it will returns the face locations.
  - Please note the limited API usage (up to 1000 / month) in free plan.
  - Draw a rectagle at the face location as the image below.
- Allow the user to take a **photo** with the front camera as default. (Use the rear camera if no front camera)

There are no restrictions on 3rd party libraries.

### Suggested Layout

The specifications are intentionally vague to allow creative leeway on the UI/layout implementation but we suggest having at least two screens:

1. A camera view screen
2. A face detection result screen
